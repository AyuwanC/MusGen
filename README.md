# MusGen
Generate Music using Deep Learning

# Aim
The plan is to develop a Music Generation model using deep learning, specifically RNNs(recurrent neural networks) and LSTMs(long short-term memory networks).The model will be trained on a music database. 
The aim is to create a suitable architecture for implementing these models and modify the code such that the music generated aligns with key music theory concepts like key, time signature, and basic resolution.
The broad domain of the work is called Music Information Retrieval (MIR), which is an intersection of Audio Processing, Deep Learning as well as some Cognitive Psychology.
